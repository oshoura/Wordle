# Worlde Replica

I wanted to challenge myself to make a Wordle Replica. I was still new to react and CSS and saw some learning opportunities. I made all my own components, CSS classes and animations. I had a lot of fun making it.

In React, I created the board, and cards components. I implemented all the logic for rendering those cards and determining each character's status. I used all of my own CSS styling and spent a lot of time working on the card animations.

## What I learned
Overall, I felt like this was just a fun project to do. Suprisingly, I ended up learnign a lot about CSS even though I meant this as a React project. Getting the look of my front end right is usually pretty challenging for me, so this helped me get more confident with CSS. I also had to overcome some challenges in React regarding how to pass data through the components. I was able to learn a lot about the React framework and CSS

## Next Steps
These are the things I can do that I feel will teach me the most
- Publish the front end to a website
- Create a back end and host it to pick a new word every 24 hours
